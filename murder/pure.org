**** ep 4
i use emacs, this task is beneath me
no, what?
we live at the edge of a knife, this video could doom us all

i'm off the clock
i chose emacs, not because it's easy, but because i'm hard

i call bullshit on this plot twist
dreams die, college is fake but student debt is real
other peoples problems are boring, feelings are for women and dead people
